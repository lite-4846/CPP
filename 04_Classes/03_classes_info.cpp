// OOPs - Classes and Objects

// C++   --> Initially called "C with classes" by Stroustroup
// class --> Extension of structures (in C)
// structures and members
    //   - members are public
    //   - No methods
        
// classes --> structures + more
// classes --> can have properties and methods
// classes --> can have few private members and few public members

// structures in C++ are typedef
// you can declare objects along with class declaration like this : 
    /* class Employee{
        // class defination
    } luffy, zoro, sanji; */

// luffy.lover = 6; makes no sense if lover is private
